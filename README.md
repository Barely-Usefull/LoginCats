# LoginCats

Little Python script that print out a random picture of cats from specified directory upon login in your shell.

# Install
Insure that you have chafa.py pip package:

`pip3 install chafa.py`

Clone this repository somewhere:

`git clone https://github.com/Barely-Usefull/LoginCats`

Depending on your shell next step may or may be not relevant to you:
add this line to your start up file:

`python3 <where you cloned repo>/LoginCats.py <where you cloned repo>/cats/`

For bash and zsh users required files are .bashlogin and .zlogin in the home directory.

You can optionally write a message that will be displayed after the image. To do this add the message in " " after main command like this:

`python3 <where you cloned repo>/LoginCats.py <where you cloned repo>/cats/ "message"`
